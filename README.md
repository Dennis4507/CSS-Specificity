# CSS-Specificity
A CSS declaration that is more specific will take precedence over less specific ones.

First Edit

Here We introduced two CSS rules and seems like rule 2 has more class selectors than ID selectors therefore ID takes prescedence and the color that will be selected is Green

Second Edit.

We will place the Heading into a Box with (width is 300px and height is 100px)
and also place the pharagraph into a Box as well (width is also 300px and height is 100px)
